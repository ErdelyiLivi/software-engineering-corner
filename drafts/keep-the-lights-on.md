Error handling is rather neglected in software projects and is more of a minor matter. No wonder, as it is much better to concentrate on business value and features. Unfortunately, this can be very annoying for users. Even worse, it can end in disaster.

> In August 2013, Google experienced a five-minute outage, resulting in an estimated loss of $545,000 in revenue. Users were unable to perform searches or access other Google services during that time.

Or a similar example.

> In 2013, Amazon faced issues with its online retail system during a one-hour outage, potentially causing a loss of $66,240 per minute. The total estimated loss was around $3.85 million.

As we have seen, even one single minute of downtime can costÂ a fortune or have legal implications.

Yes, my examples are about very big, well-known companies. You might think this does not concern you and your software projects. **You are wrong.** Most public-facing applications have a monetary or legal aspect.
