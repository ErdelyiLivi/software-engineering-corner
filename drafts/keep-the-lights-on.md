Error handling is rather neglected in software projects and is more of a minor matter. No wonder, as it is much better to concentrate on business value and features. Unfortunately, this can be very annoying for users. Even worse, it can end in disaster.

> In August 2013, Google experienced a five-minute outage, resulting in an estimated loss of $545,000 in revenue. Users were unable to perform searches or access other Google services during that time.

Or a similar example.

> In 2013, Amazon faced issues with its online retail system during a one-hour outage, potentially causing a loss of $66,240 per minute. The total estimated loss was around $3.85 million.

As we have seen, even one single minute of downtime can costÂ a fortune or have legal implications.

Yes, my examples are about very big, well-known companies. You might think this does not concern you and your software projects. **You are wrong.** Most public-facing applications have a monetary or legal aspect.

## Design for failure

First I want to talk about the current situation. At this point, we might have realized that proper error handling is important. In reality, unfortunately, the realization usually looks very poor.

We know all those little nice error popups thrown into our faces when an error has occurred in the application we are working on. Sadly, this is common practice in most applications. Exceptions bubble up to the frontend, get displayed in an error dialog and nothing works anymore. And be honest, most likely you implemented such an error dialog as well.

But why is it so in the most cases? I actually can't blame the developers, or at least not for implementing it. The problem is located way deeper in the system. The entire team, from the developers to POs, BAs and UX engineers, is focused on designing and delivering features. We all strive for a cool and user-friendly product, the timeline is short and features should rather be released yesterday than tomorrow. In addition, not all are aware of errors that can occur. At least I haven't seen any UX engineers thinking about it on their own. So nobody is thinking about it and providing the dead-end error dialog is the final resort the developers have.

And that's why we need to sit together as a whole team. Making everyone deeply aware of failures that can occur and bake error handling in. We need to design error handling in the system and define how it should behave in every single scenario.

## Keep the lights on

I have been talking about the root cause of missing proper error handling. The question remains, what can we do to prevent these error dialogs? There are some cases when nothing works anymore but in many cases, we handle them and keep the application running.

It is better to degrade the functionality of an application than let it stop working. It is important to inform the user about the misbehavior, but let him keep doing his work within the limits of what is still possible. This way the user can make its own decision on how to proceed.

Let's give some examples:

We display personal information in our app and resolve the person's address from an external address service. When this service returns a failure or is unreachable we can display that information to the user.
