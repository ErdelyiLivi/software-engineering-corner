# Navigating the Challenges of Pair Programming: Lessons from My Journey

Pair programming is a powerful tool in the software development process, but like any tool, it comes with its own set of challenges. 
From feeling overwhelmed by a partner’s pace to navigating the complexities of remote collaboration, I’ve experienced a range of obstacles in my pair programming journey. 
But through trial and error, reflection, and a deep dive into the subject, I’ve discovered strategies to overcome these hurdles and to improve my pair programming quality. 
In this blog post, I’ll share the mistakes I made along the way and the lessons I learned, so you can avoid these pitfalls and make the most of your pair programming sessions. 
Whether you’re a seasoned developer or a newcomer to the field, I hope my experiences can provide valuable insights to enhance your pair programming practice. 
Let’s dive in!


## Pair programming mistakes I made, so you don't have to
I recently had the feeling that I'm missing out a lot of potential when pair programming.
I couldn't point down my finger what was the problem, but I felt, that I could do better.
I started to read into the topic, reflect on my pair-programming sessions and tried out different styles and approaches of pair programming.
In this blog, I would like to point about several mistakes I made when pair programming, so that you dont need to do them as well.

When I dived into the topic, I realized that it's following the [Bushnell's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushnell%27s_Law).
While its easy to understand the main concepts like driver - navigator, it's a very difficult topic to master.
If you're interested in the theory and different styles of pair-programming, I can highly recommend the article ["on pair programming" from martin fowler](https://martinfowler.com/articles/on-pair-programming.html). 

As a prelude, I see pair programming as people's business and it's therefore highly subjective.
The following examples based on my own experiences and how I felt about it. 


## Overwhelmed by the Driver's Pace
In the early days of my pair programming experience, right after university, I found myself working with another newcomer to the team.
We were both strangers to each other and the project, which added an extra layer of complexity to our collaboration.

Our roles were clearly defined - he was the driver , I was the navigator.
As we ventured into the new project and environment, I found his pace challenging to match.
Since he was already a senior, he was swift in his actions, and I often found myself trailing behind, struggling to keep up.

My unfamiliarity with him and the fear of appearing less competent held me back from asking him to slow down.
This was further complicated by his eagerness to showcase his skills.

While at the time, I could not find a solution to the problem, the remedy to this situation is not as complex as it seems.
It’s about acknowledging the presence of [imposter syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) and fostering open communication.
It’s crucial to remember that it’s okay not to know everything and that it’s perfectly fine to ask questions.
After all, pair programming is as much about learning as it is about coding.
Effective communication forms the backbone of successful pair programming, making it a rewarding experience for both parties involved.

## The Trap of No Breaks
Despite being aware of the importance of breaks and switch-ups, I often find myself falling into the trap of continuous pairing. 
When I’m in the flow, time seems to slip away unnoticed, which also happens often when pairing.
The driver does not switch with the navigator after a committable segment, and we continue to push forward.

Contrary to popular belief, being in the flow isn’t always advantageous. 
As Uncle Bob points out, it can lead to fatigue and a decrease in productivity. 
Our brains get tired, and we often find ourselves stuck on minor problems, a phenomenon known as the [XY problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_problem).

I noticed, that in this continuous work state, the quality of communication rapidly decreases.
We all start to think about our own problem and ignore our partner. 
This greatly reduces efficiency or even leads to us no longer being effective.

The key to avoiding this trap is to remember to take regular breaks, switch roles and ensure effective communication at all times. 
This not only helps to keep our minds fresh but also ensures that we are on the same page throughout the process.

## Guiding a Junior
I recently had the situation, where I pair programmed with a junior developer who had just joined our team.
As a more experienced developer, I took on the role of the navigator while the junior, understandably nervous due to his newness to the team, was the driver.
During our pairing session, I provided many tips and tricks to the junior, particularly on how to navigate within the IDE.
However, I noticed that our progress significantly slowed down.

In retrospect, I realized that I had unintentionally overwhelmed him. 
Eager to show his appreciation for my guidance, he tried to apply all my suggestions instantly. 
His focus shifted entirely to mastering IDE shortcuts, diverting his attention away from the actual problem we were trying to solve.
Pair programming is an excellent opportunity for knowledge sharing, but it’s crucial that this exchange happens in digestible bites, not all at once. 
This is particularly important when pairing with someone who is eager to improve and prove themselves.
I’ve since learned to prioritize establishing a trusting relationship where it’s okay to fail and not know everything.
This approach is especially beneficial when working with someone new to the team, as it helps alleviate their nervousness and allows them to focus more on learning and problem-solving.


## Remote Pairing under Non-Ideal Conditions
There was an instance when a colleague and I attempted to pair program remotely. 
We experienced first minor but with time larger delay, which initially caused us frustration. 
However, not wanting to constantly complain, we tried to cope with the situation.

Unfortunately, the delay made it nearly impossible to follow the driver’s actions, and we eventually had to stop the pairing session. 
This experience underscored the importance of having an excellent setup and high-quality connection for remote pair programming. 
Even minor issues can become major distractions, diverting focus from the task at hand.

If given the choice, it’s preferable to pair program in front of the same screen. 
But if remote pairing is necessary, ensuring a seamless and high-quality connection is paramount to a successful and productive session.


## Concluding Thoughts
The effectiveness of pair programming is tremendously influenced by soft skills and the dynamics between the two individuals involved. 
Factors such as personality traits (introvert vs extrovert), experience levels (junior vs senior), and familiarity with 
each other (new to the team vs well-acquainted) can have a monumental impact on the quality and productivity of the pairing session.

It’s essential to adjust the focus of the pairing session depending on the circumstances. 
For instance, if the pair programmers are not well-acquainted with each other, the initial focus should be on establishing a good dynamic and rapport.
Furthermore, it’s crucial not to overwhelm a junior developer with too much information at once, whether it’s project specifics, domain knowledge, or IDE shortcuts. 
Information should be shared in digestible chunks to ensure effective learning and application.

In conclusion, pair programming, despite its challenges, is a valuable practice in software development. 
It promotes collaborative problem-solving, continuous learning, and high-quality software development. 
By embracing the challenges and learning from them, developers can continually improve their pair programming skills.
