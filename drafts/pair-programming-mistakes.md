# Pair programming mistakes I made, so you don't have to
I recently had the feeling that I'm missing out a lot of potential when pair programming.
I couldn't point down my finger what was the problem, but I felt, that I could do better.
I started to read into the topic, reflect on my pair-programming sessions and tried out different styles and approaches of pair programming.
In this blog, i would like to point about several mistakes I made when pairprogramming, so that you dont need to do them as well.

When I dived into the topic, i realized that its following the [Bushnell's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushnell%27s_Law).
While its easy to understand the main concepts like driver - navigator, its a very difficult topic to master.
If you're interested in the theory and different styles of pair-programming, i can highly recommend the article ["on pair programming" from martin fowler](https://martinfowler.com/articles/on-pair-programming.html). 

As a prelude, I see pair programming as people's business and its therefore highly subjective. The following examples based on my own experiences and how i felt about it. 


## Overwhelmed by the Driver's Pace
In the early days of my pair programming experience, right after university, I found myself working with another newcomer to the team.
We were both strangers to each other and the project, which added an extra layer of complexity to our collaboration.

Our roles were clearly defined - he was the driver , I was the navigator.
As we ventured into the new project and environment, I found his pace challenging to match.
Since he was already a senior, he was swift in his actions, and I often found myself trailing behind, struggling to keep up.

My unfamiliarity with him and the fear of appearing less competent held me back from asking him to slow down.
This was further complicated by his eagerness to showcase his skills.

While at the time, i could not find a solution to the problem, the remedy to this situation is not as complex as it seems.
It’s about acknowledging the presence of [imposter syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) and fostering open communication.
It’s crucial to remember that it’s okay not to know everything and that it’s perfectly fine to ask questions.
After all, pair programming is as much about learning as it is about coding.
Effective communication forms the backbone of successful pair programming, making it a rewarding experience for both parties involved.

## No breaks
although i know about it, it happens still all the time to me. When in the flow, time passes. You dont switch driver after commitable segment. Show link of beeing in the flow is not advantageous (uncle bob). Get tired in brain, usually stuck in a neglectable problem, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY\_problem,  diverging thinking (each thinks about its own issue) since comunication is off or not on point anymore

## junior as driver
Nervous driver as junior, want to show off his skills.
Opportunity of providing tips and tricks, especially in navigating in IDE. Focus on tips and tricks which are important, or tell at the end. Had the problem, that junior was overwhelmed by IDE short cuts - which ended up absorbing his brain power in IDE controlling instead of thinking about the problem. He wanted to show that he appreciate the tips and wanted to use them instantly.

## Remote pairing under non-ideal conditions
Example of ädu and me pairing. We had a delay (up to 30 sec), which first annoyed us (but you dont want to always complain, so you cope with it) and then we stopped pairing, because you could not follow the driver


## concluding thoughts
Softskills tremendiously effect how to communicate and effectively pair. Introvert vs extrovert, junior vs senior, know each other or not
set the focus on pairing depending on the circumstances (if you dont know each other, focus on getting a good dynamic first before interrupting too often etc)
