# Pair programming mistakes I made, so you don't have to
pair programming is people business and therefore highly subjective, the following examples are from my own experience and how i felt about it.

I recently had the feeling that I'm missing out a lot of potential when pair programming. In this blog, i would like to point about several mistakes I made when pairprogramming, so that you dont need to do them as well.

Show curve of easy to initially improve, but hard to master. Link to Martin Fowler's blog post about pair progrmaming, since its an excellent source to pair progrmaming.

## Beeing overwhelmed by driver
example of pairing with alex in first camp in Rigi
\begin{itemize}
\item setup: he was driver, i was trying to follow in a new project / environment
\item alex was too fast, i could not follow
\item since i knew him not, i was scaried to look dump, which prevented me to slow him more down
\item vice versa, he was new and wanted to show off his skills
\end{itemize}
Remedy: imposter syndrome, talk openly - noone knows everything

## No breaks
although i know about it, it happens still all the time to me. When in the flow, time passes. You dont switch driver after commitable segment. Show link of beeing in the flow is not advantageous (uncle bob). Get tired in brain, usually stuck in a neglectable problem, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY\_problem,  diverging thinking since comunication is off or not on point anymore

## junior as driver
Nervous driver as junior, want to show off his skills.
Opportunity of providing tips and tricks, especially in navigating in IDE. Focus on tips and tricks which are important, or tell at the end. Had the problem, that junior was overwhelmed by IDE short cuts - which ended up absorbing his brain power in IDE controlling instead of thinking about the problem. He wanted to show that he appreciate the tips and wanted to use them instantly.

## Remote pairing under non-ideal conditions
Example of Ã¤du and me pairing. We had a delay (up to 30 sec), which first annoyed us (but you dont want to always complain, so you cope with it) and then we stopped pairing, because you could not follow the driver


## concluding thoughts
Softskills tremendiously effect how to communicate and effectively pair. Introvert vs extrovert, junior vs senior, know each other or not
set the focus on pairing depending on the circumstances (if you dont know each other, focus on getting a good dynamic first before interrupting too often etc)
