## What do we call Web Development Tools?
Do you know that web development tools can cover a lot of things? From the IDE till the Browser extensions it can cover everything that we are using in our everyday development. Let’s take a closer look at which one(s) can best support our dev tasks.
### What fits best? 
As always it depends. There are multiple factors that we should consider when choosing a tool. Complexity, security, scalability, cost, supported programming languages and platform support are the factors that are recommended to check in advance.

## Let's see the high rated options
### Chrome Developer Tools
When we talk in general about dev tools, the first that comes into everybody’s mind is the Chrome Developer Tools. And that’s absolutely right. That is one of the most known and used WebDevTool. It is a set of web editing and debugging tools built into the Google Chrome browser. It helps view and update web pages, styles, debug Javascript code and optimize website speed. It has a tool called Lighthouse,  which can perform audits on web pages and auto-generate reports based on performance, accessibility, progressive web apps (PWA), and SEO. Chrome DevTool also can do local overrides, has web design features, like its inspect element tool or color picker. It has also built in security features, console utility and device model.

##### Some feature worth mentioning
###### View and change Page Content and Styles
We can edit the HTML directly in the tool. It can be done in two different ways. in the console, by selecting the element or directly in the HTML panel by double clicking the content we want to change.

CSS prototyping is also possible in the tool. For this, just select the element in the DOM tree and add declarations to the element in the styles panel. We can change font color, size and type. We can change background and button colors, images and so on.
###### Debug Javascript
All our javascript files are readable in the tool. With that we can quickly locate problems, dig deeper into code, debug and test out new code directly in the browser. We can also edit this code on the fly without having to switch to an editor or IDE.
###### Running JS and viewing messages in the Console
It is also possible to run code directly in the console or sending messages to the console for testing purposes. Another feature that can come handy there is testing selectors.

### Visual Studio Code
Visual Studio Code is an open-source code editor that runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS. It includes built-in features such as syntax highlighting, auto-complete, and Git commands to make coding faster and easier. It supports most common programming languages. It has a huge library of extensions. It is also possible to customize the user interface and split the view and work on two projects at the same time.

##### Some details about the coolest features
###### Command Palette
The Command Palette allows us to access various available commands just by typing keywords instead of navigating through menus.

###### Zen Mode
Zen Mode is a distraction-free view. All extra toolboxes and bars in the window are removed, allowing to focus completely on the code. It is also possible to center-align the code, to experience a view like a document editor.
###### Split view
Is good if we need to compare two files or want to see both of them at the same time.

###### Tag wrapping
Emmet is a plugin that can save time and improve developer productivity by helping to type less and generate more code.

###### Git integration
The Git integration makes it possible to commit, pull and push code changes to a remote Git repository.

###### New themes and plugins
VS Code allows to apply a theme to text syntax highlighting in the editor based on preferences. There are many themes in the VS Marketplace that are free.

###### Command line
VS Code comes with an integrated command-line terminal. On Windows, the terminal shows up as the Command Prompt. On Mac and Linux it shows up as Bash prompt.

###### Go to definition
While programming or scripting, it can often happen that we face ourselves with a variable or method that we don't know. In that case this feature can come handy, because it makes possible to jump right to the definition of it.

### Sublime Text
Another editor, the Sublime Text, is a good choice for beginners. It is an all in one text editor for code and markup. As key features we can mention the easy switch between files and functions, the Javascript and Typescript support, the Python API, the cross-platform functionality and many more.

#### Main features

###### Autocompletion, Syntax Highlight, Code Folding
Sublime has native support for a lot of programming languages and can color elements appropriately. The code editor is also able to warn of parsing errors in real time. Code Folding makes large pieces of code more compact to view by hiding parts of it.

###### Customizability
Sublime Text can be fully customized via plugins. The integrated Package Manager allows us to find, install, upgrade and remove plugins directly from inside the editor, usually without restart. We can download packages from Github, Bitbucket and PackageControl.io. PackageControl.io is Sublime's own repository, where the community behind the code editor publishes loads of plugins to enhance its capabilities. There are more than 3800 packages available.

###### Lightweight, Fast and Stable
It starts fast and crashes rarely. What else do we need?

###### Powerful search
Fast and powerful search is also an important feature. Its regular search and replace function can look for regular expressions, make sensitive searches or look for whole words. Plus we can add search results to buffer for later use.

###### Simultaneous editing
One of the most interesting features of Sublime Text is the ability to use several cursors at the same time. That means it is possible to make the same edit in several places at the same time. The same feature can be used to reformat several lines of code at the same time.

###### Minimap
It is a small file overview in the upper right corner. It is useful to get an idea of how large the open file is and also shows the current position while moving the scrollbar. 

###### Screens and panels
It has the ability to display text files in different ways. First we can have several files ordered in tabs like in a browser window. That's the standard way. More than that, we can display up to four files at once if form of a grid. Plus Sublime Text comes with other layout options like columns and rows as well as fullscreen and distraction free editing modes.

### Marvel
Next on the list is Marvel, but no, not the movies. Marvel is a wireframing tool to quickly and easily design projects. It can create high quality mockups and design specifications for web applications. It can generate CSS, Swift, and Android XML code for elements. It can record screen, audio and video for easier testing and feedback handling. It also has hundreds of customizable templates.

##### Feature overview
###### Interactive prototyping

### Sketch
According to TechRadar currently the best overall tool is Sketch, which is a toolkit for digital designs. It can create simple animations, clickable prototypes and it has cloud collaboration. The only downside is that it is only available for Mac.

##### Feature overview
###### Vector editing
Sketch's vector tools are pixel-perfect and precise, specifically to high-quality graphic design. It makes it simpler to craft detailed icons and illustrations.

###### Artboards
It allows designers to create multiple artboards into a single sketch file, streamlining the web page and iOS app design process by organizing different screens and states efficiently. It also provides scrolling artboards that simulate the scrolling experience of web pages and iOS interfaces, helping in creating realistic prototypes and mockups.

###### Symbols
Symbols in Sketch enable reusable elements, such as buttons and icons, ensuring consistency across the designed web application or mobile design. At the same time it allows rapid updates across multiple instances.

###### CSS Export
It is able to generate CSS code from design elements directly, speeding up the transition from design to development.

###### Collaboration features
Sketch supports real-time collaboration, which allows the team members to work together synchronously on the same sketch file and enhancing workflow efficiency.

###### Plugins
Its extensive plugin ecosystem is user-friendly and can fulfill specific design needs, from automating repetitive tasks to integrating with social media platforms.

###### Export options
Sketch's export options are robost, allowing designers to output designs in multiple formats, resolutions and configurations, which is crucial when preparing designs for web pages, apps and social media.

###### Integrations
It integrates with other tools like InVision, Zeplin and Jira. It provides an API, that allows custom plugin development, which kan expand its functionalities further. A wild range of available add-ons can significantly extend the utility, enabling users to integrate with additional services and automate various aspects of the design flow.

### +1 Github
We also have Github on the list. It is an open-source, cloud-based Git repository hosting service. It also offers a web based graphic interface. In my opinion it is not a real web development tool, but it can support the productive development lifecycle very well. Its key features are Github Copilot, pull requests and code reviews, codespaces, automations like CI / CD support and many others.
